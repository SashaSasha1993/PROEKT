                With autum and winter quickly approaching, all parents are concerned with making sure their children's wardrobe is up to date. First and foremost this means proper outerwear.</p>
            <p>We expect our kids to have proper attire that will be both stylish and keep them warm all season long. It should be warm for those windy winter days, waterproof for the rain and slush, but also breathable for sunny days and easy to care for, not to mention reliable! Of course, it should also be convenient for the movement of the baby. Any good jacket should be able to keep you comfortable and warm whenever and wherever you may go, and all this - for a reasonable price!!</p>
            <p>Despite the wide variety, picking a high-quality product at a reasonable price is not so simple. In fact, it can often be difficult to distinguish higher quality outerwear from the average counterfeit, which can decieve consumers with a decent appearance "before the first wash," but whose service life is often limited to a single season. To put you at ease, we bring the valued the Canadian NANO trademark to our products which will ensure a worthy place for our outerwear in your baby's closet for years to come. To date, it is difficult to imagine a company that is more renowned for their reliability than NANO. With more than 200 stores worldwide, the Nano brand is synonymous with sleek, reliable, and reasonably priced products, from jackets, trousers, sets, and coats to hats, mittens. </p>

    <h2>PELUCHE & TARTINE</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-9">
            <p>Peluche et Tartine is a favorite label for parents seeking quality, style and durability at an affordable price. Inspired by today’s trends, our designers reinvent classics styles for coats, rain gear, snow suits and accessories for children aged 3 months to 8 years old. Its bright colors, playful embroidery and varied prints appeal to children’s fashion sense.</p>
            <p>The main difference between the NANO and PELUCHE & TARTINE rulers is the waterproofness of the membrane (3000 mm for PELUCHE & TARTINE, 5000 mm for NANO).</p>
            <p>The assortment and size range of NANO is much wider. And most importantly, these rulers differ in style. If in NANO the color range is calmer, and the models are more mature, PELUCHE & TARTINE is dominated by bright colors, "children's" funny prints and embroideries. The price difference between NANO and PELUCHE is approximately 20%.</p>
